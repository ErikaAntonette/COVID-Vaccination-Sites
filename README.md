# COVID-Vaccination-Sites

*******************************************
This is the MATLAB implementation of the optimization methods used in the paper "Optimal Selection of COVID-19 Vaccination Sites at the Municipal Level."

### Execution Instructions
*******************************************

Run the ff. files:
1. single_obj_enum.m - single-objective code by enumeration
2. single_obj_ga1.m - single-objective code using Genetic Algorithm (I)
3. single_obj_ga2.m - single-objective code using Genetic Algorithm (II)
5. multi_obj.m - multi-objective code by enumeration

### Edit (20 August 2022): Added new file "dynamic_optimization.m"
*******************************************
"dynamic_optimization.m" features a dynamic optimization approach that recalculates optimal vaccination sites for different schedules to exclude barangays that have already completed their vaccination.
